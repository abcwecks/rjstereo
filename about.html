    <p>The Russo-Japanese War Stereograph Archive is the most comprehensive listing of all stereographs documenting the war between 1904 and 1906. It currently features over 400 stereographs from nearly 14 different publishers, including Underwood &amp; Underwood, Keystone View Company, and T. W. Ingersoll.</p>

    <p>The Russo-Japanese War is often regarded as one of the first conflicts to be extensively documented through photography, anticipating similar practices in twentieth-century warfare. Stereographs played a distinctive role in making photographic records of this international conflict affordable and accessible to American and European households at a time when newspapers had only recently adopted halftone printing and books with photographs remained costly and relatively uncommon.</p>

    <p>Publishing companies dispatched photographers to create a collection of stereoviews. This included the well-known Underwood &amp; Underwood stereographer, James Ricalton, and T. W. Ingersoll’s Richard Barry, who later wrote, <em>Port Arthur: A Monster Heroism</em>. Many of the American publishers had photographers primarily documenting the conflict from the Japanese side. However, there are a handful of views taken alongside the Czar’s army, most notably by an unknown photographer who shot for B. W. Kilburn.</p>

    <p>Within this list is a wealth of information valuable to any historian wishing to know more about the Russo-Japanese War. Information can be found on subjects ranging from military leaders, the local Korean and Chinese populations, medicine, artillery, transportation, and cuisine.</p>

    <p>It is also a rich record of the diversity of public opinion surrounding the war, particularly in the United States. Publishers, invoking the supposed scientific objectivity of stereography, often claimed to present events without bias. Yet, a closer reading of image captions and card versos reveals that some writers infused their accounts with racially, politically, and religiously charged perspectives. As such, these stereographs document not only the war and its participants, but also the international interpretations and biases that shaped contemporary understandings of the conflict.</p>
